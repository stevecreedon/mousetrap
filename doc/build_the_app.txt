1. Create the application

	rails new mousetrap
	
1.1 Take a look at what its created.



2. Add the Rspec gem

2.1 Take a look at Rspec-rails on github and read the docs.

2.2 Add the rspec-rails gem to bundler's Gemfile in the test and development groups only so that it's not needed on production

	group :test, :development do
		gem 'rspec-rails', "~> 2.0"
	end
	
2.3 Install the gem

	bundle install

2.4 Add rspec-rails generators

	bundle exec rails generate rspec:install
	
2.5 Take a look at the files it's created

	
	
3. Add the Devise gem

3.1 add the devise gem to bundlers Gemfile

	gem 'devise'
	
3.2 install devise

    rails generate devise:install

3.3 look at the files devise has created and read the notes:

      create  config/initializers/devise.rb
      create  config/locales/devise.en.yml
===============================================================================

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here 
     is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment 
     in config/environments/development.rb:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

  2. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
     For example:

       root :to => "home#index"

  3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
     For example:

       <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
       <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>

  4. If you are deploying Rails 3.1 on Heroku, you may want to set:

       config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false

     On config/application.rb forcing your application to not access the DB
     or load models when precompiling your assets.

===============================================================================



4 Create a User model with devise

	rails generate devise user
	
4.1 Take a look at what it's created:

     invoke  active_record
	 create    db/migrate/20120629090415_devise_create_users.rb
	 create    app/models/user.rb
	 invoke    rspec
	 create      spec/models/user_spec.rb
	 insert    app/models/user.rb
	 route  devise_for :users

4.2 Run the migration

     bundle exec rake db:migrate



5 Add Factory Girl

Halfway between fixtures & mocks

5.1 Add the factory girl gem to the Gemfile in the test & development group

    group :test, :development do
        gem 'factory_girl_rails'
	    gem 'rspec-rails', "~> 2.0"
    end

5.2 Install the gem

    bundle install
